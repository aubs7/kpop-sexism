**K-Pop Sexism Detection**

A repository created for an undergraduate thesis [**"A Semi-Supervised Approach for Sexism Detection in K-Pop Posts"**](https://github.com/aubs7/kpop-sexism/blob/main/Study%20in%20K-pop%20Sexism%20Detection.pdf)

This repository primarily features an **unlabeled K-pop-related tweets dataset** used to build a hybrid sexism detection model. It consists of **11,211** English tweets from popular K-pop scandals and sexist keywords, of which 1,040 came from the Garam bullying scandal generated [Sainez and Wu in 2022](https://github.com/tsainez/kpop-sentiment-analysis), and the 10,171 were manually scraped by [Aubrey Min Lasala](https://github.com/aubs7) & [Britney Beligan](https://github.com/BritneyBeligan) from January to April 2025.
