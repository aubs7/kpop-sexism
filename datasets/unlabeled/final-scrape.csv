13,Seulgi talked about how ITZY’s Not Shy Live Dance Practice Video went mega viral and Yeji said that it wasn’t planned but JYPE find it amazing that they uploaded it right away which then Yeji found thankful because the people appreciated their talents!
14,Then blame new kpop stan who obsessed with synchronization. That's nothing to do with TOP. CL & Park BOM 2NE1 can just stand still with full of charisma without breaking their bone for dance bcs their fans are not retarted & dance fetish like newer fans nowadays
15,"There are multiple ggs, like RV who have light, girly dances and there are many other ggs too. Have you seen 2NE1 “I don’t care” ? They weren’t bashed for dancing because they’re not DANCE group  they make dance more about fun rather than choreo

YES, OPEN THE SCHOOLS FOR KPOP"
16,Jennie from bp and Lia from itzy were called lazy tho just because their energy is not the same as their other members
17,i hope t.o.p realizes how lucky he is to be born a male cause if a woman did this she‘d be torn apart
18,"Jennie of bp was called lazy because her hands were not as straight as the other members itzy's Lia was called lazy too just because her movements are not as powerful as the other members, in the video top was not showing the same energy as the other members but he's called cool"
19,"i think people notice and know but the general reputation itzy have on stan twt is that they are ""bad singers"" and are more of a performance/dance group and this whole narrative also targets lia bc they always downgrade her abilities as a main vocalist just bc the doesn't do runs"
20,i feel like people forget that itzy danceline are seriously extraordinary dancers and tbh a lot of idols wouldnt look like great dancers surrounded by them. lia is such a hard working and resilient person and shes really a good dancer but people are just too cruel
21,Are u kidding me mam… itzy cant sing.. even lazy lia cant scream… Aespa has daesang while ur itzy are not and their song is flop every release
22,"interesting how the part that explains why lia was confused was conveniently cut out. they were not meant to perform it, the song was playing in the background while they were interacting with fans but the members started dancing and she caught right up"
23,"I genuinely do not understand why kpop fans are treating itzy as punching bags

To my knowledge, none of the girls are problematic. Their fandom isn’t toxic either

But why do kpop fans keep on belittling itzy?"
24,"people hated on lia during itzys debut bc there was a rumor that she “paid her way” into itzy, then people hated on her for “lazy/bad dancing” and they’ve kinda just been stuck on the second one"
25,"Who? Itzy? Are someone said lia have lazy dance too? RV? Excuse me.. are they song have like boombayah? Majimak chorom? Whistle?. You know, bringing another gg as a defense for your idol will only make him look bad."
26,and yeji said it herself: lia suits slower songs and choreos bc she can make those movements look prettier and it's okay! it's not easy to perform itzy's fast choreographies so you can't blame her for sometimes compromising some moves and energy she puts into them
27,"most complete idol yet cant even reach her parts in their songs? the only thing she can do is dance, she cant even write a song. believe what u want to believe but aespa will always be known and talented"
28,"where did ur narrative came from? even tho g didnt train for LONG, she's still more talented than any itzy member btw, a better vocalist, rapper, and writer than all of them! while winter is nowhere near lazy when she's also like the main vocalist while lia came from hiatus but"
29,dozenlia cant even move her legs while giselle showed improvements every year and winter is a lead vocalist but is outsinging everyone in itzy including their dozen 'main vocalist'
30,"How can you try to justify Giselle's lack of preparation for her debut and want to justify Winter and her laziness with being a lead vocalist?  girl, she's an idol, not a restaurant showgirl, Lia at least kept up with Itzy during her best choreographies"
31,and Lia still dancing better than Giselle and winter sleeping
32,midshits were busy ass licking other fandoms to attack aespa and now this is their fav
33,"I never assuming bad, I just don’t listening to ITZY in their last two comeback. Idk, maybe I’m too lazy because no Lia there, even my bias is Ryujin. Idk"
34,"itzy’s music is just so different without lia’s voice i mean its still good but it’s really missing sumn, lia really is the main vocalist for a reason."
35,"What you're talking about is her decision to speak in hiatus, we're talking about Lia. At the start of the Kill My Dought album, she was anything but smiling, feeling sad and anxious, and even more so when she received a wave of hatred from the Korean Midzy. You're serious"
36,"no i will speak about lia because you cant fucking tell me that it was her decision to completely stop the job she has been working for years, all of the solo projects itzy could have done them last year so they wouldnt have to promote without her"
37,do not follow or interact with me if you're ot4 itzy i'm very serious lia is the vocal backbone of the group if you can't respect her hiatus you're a horrible person
38,"idk who needs to hear this, but itzy is a literal dance focused group and they would not have let lia in if she wasn’t a good dancer"
39,shut up until lia comes to a live.why are you complaining about yeji when lia only does one live?please stop bullying the leader of itzy and focus on the members who is really lazy
40,"the only person who is lazy is lia, she makes no efforts to become better at singing or dancing unlike giselle who has admitted to her flaws and has actually improved.   https://x.com/khia_phobia/st/khia_phobia/status/1749355040161272012…"
41,"ppl calling itzy flops and complaining about their change in music direction doesn’t compare to the xenophobic and racist things idle have been thrown since debut, ‘u wouldn’t survive’ SIT DOWN"
42,"probably soyeon on her own gets more hate than itzy.. anyway why do midzy’s make it a competition, its not good that both groups get hate and it should stop either way"
43,You haven't even seen itzy get half of the hate that (g)i-dle and soyeon gets. https://x.com/yejiiiiiz/stat/yejiiiiiz/status/1749143730412466199…

45,"ITZY’s Lia Faces The “Lazy Dancer” Criticism Again, After Her “Idol Radio” Appearance"
46,lia is not leaving itzy no matter how much y'all want lmao she's gonna come back stronger than ever cause every tongue that rises against her and itzy shall fall
47,"lisa cant rap, cant sing, cant write, cant invest in her own work, she also admitted shes just a dancer, had the floppiest album, dating a zio, her tt left the chart after 10days,but somehow you want to xonvince me jennie aint bp most famous and successful mmbr, sure."
48,not ryujin confidently saying lia is the weakest in itzy but lost in an arm wrestle with lia
49,"In a recent performance, ITZY's LIA & RYUJIN appeared to have difficulty keeping up with the rest of the group. 

Fans are questioning why LIA took a hiatus if she was going to return & still show signs of laziness."
50,"You know, Lia is the most flexible member of itzy.She was even a  contemporary dancer in her school.She has great fluidity and her dance suits slow pace songs than fast ones.Itzy mostly had fast paced but she can still dance it very well."
51,"Kpop twitter has fallen into a space where people think hitting high notes is singing. Lia is a gift to ITZY, she has a voice that should be treasured in the kpop industry, it’s not often you hear a beautiful voice like this. I hope her voice is utilised to its fullest potential"

65,"She really said ‘if I’m going down, I’m taking y’all with me’"
66,Helpppp… I know a few idols who used the exact same excuses and came back from hiatus looking like a whole different person.
67,"daisy is genuinely one of my favorite tiktok account because she's always speaking truthfully and without sugarcoating her experiences in the industry, especially when there's so much stuff hidden behind the scenes these days that we dont know. mad respect"
68,Daisy exposes K-pop's hidden truths publicly.
69,the last bit is a little unnecessary to say. it now opens discussions for female idols who had hiatuses and gives people space to harass them about surgeries.
70,"i don’t care why idols go on hiatus, that will be always personal for them. But I feel like she kinda just opened a window for fans to be invasive and overall annoying about the topic"
71,"she’s allowed to talk about her personal experiences, i don’t get why yall whine every time she says something… sorry the kpop industry isn’t sunshine and rainbows like you thought i guess?"
72,"this is exactly the reason why I'm standing behind njz, everglow and many other groups who are being fucked over by their own labels, that are supposed to protect them and do their job"
73,"Former member of MOMOLAND, Daisy, talks about labels lying on hiatus reasons in some cases:

""In my hiatus meeting, they told me that the article that's coming out is going to say that you are on hiatus because of health issues, and that literally sent me over the edge.  I told"
74,"great now if any idol goes on hiatus for genuine reasons, people will just assume the worst and start slutsh@ming them."
75,"the entire of kpop twitter spent the past 6 months trying to gaslight people with braincells into thinking that anyone can just go to their label after millions invested in them and say ""we break our contract and wont pay anything btw. Bye"" one sidedly and leave unscathed"
76,"i’ve been a kpop fan for way too long for me not to support them, those girls are making history as we speak and it’s interesting to see how much people will defend a conglomerate. very interesting."
77,"Because the ""mistreatment"" they were talking about is the workers not being able to choose a sick woman as their ceo and bunch of nasty lies THEY told about other idols"
78,"Because they don’t like njz.. if it was their fav, their viewpoint would be completely different. Little do these dumbasses know that this affects the idol industry as a whole. These artists cannot speak on their experience bc nothing will happen."
79,"Imagine a company funding/marketing/pushing a group of contracted trainees to the top of the charts finding out their ""CEO"" was trying covertly to break the contract. When they fired her for cause, the kids cried mistreatment...but brought no receipts to court. Artist's rights?!"
80,stan culture really rots the brain bc why are kpop stans cheering about companies violating workers rights
81,"why y’all acting like she gotta tiptoe around szas name? she made a mistake, apologized, and took accountability. that doesn’t mean she has to stop being a fan just to dodge ppl bringing up the past– she alr owned up to it. something y'all stan list could never."

1035,"@tortoyse It's her fault too, no one has the emotion for her solo. She let it all die, how is it possible that being a singer you don't even go to music shows instead of a random show on yt, I don't even feel that there was creativity in the concept, I practically felt it was very yg 😭"

1113,"She has talent for dancing and a good stage presence, but she's wasting all of that on corny ass lyrics instead of hiring better a team for herself. She'd do much better with a generic pop track dance number than whatever she's trying to do with a concept like this"
1114,"@gvlores She just can't sing. Period. She's good at dancing, performing, her visuals are on top, that's why she's there. Not all idols have to be great singers, however, they're still giving her lines and she's just not improving... 🤷🏽‍♀️"
1115,It's so frustrating and annoying since she is someone who trained for several years before debuting then worked in the Kpop industry for years before going solo to cater to the Western market. Where did all that experience go? She wasn't the best singer or rapper when with BP

1119,RS spilled when they said she wasn’t the best at anything like y’all mad that her talent was only good enough to secure her the position of visual…the way she’s the only member that has zero talent or charisma to succeed as a soloist. Subpar and mediocre is exactly what she is
1120,Jisoo has to be the most untalented tone deaf stiff unappealing hag looking idol I have ever seen can’t hit a note or hold anyones attention. Piggybacking in her visuals all thru her career whose peak is being a member of bp. Dozen is exactly what she is and will forever be
1121,she hasn't got a talent that why she experimenting to find a good autotune. She has been solo for a few years still tanking like a flvp.
1122,"I better not see her fans talk about RAP, performance, vocals or anything in general because their girl cannot even lipsync properly let alone do anything else 💀"
1123,"@Pinkvenom4444 Sorry, but she is just a dancer. Don't try to compare her with any BTS members because they're not just dancers, they can sing live, dance, and write their own raps and songs. I also don't stan Dozen."

1575,"Cus to my recall, Beytan news was speaking on all kpop stans, so why y’all saw talentless and automatically thought jisoo."
1576,@27x1997 Me talking about blinks when I saw they brought up jisoo when op was shading talentless people :
1577,"@mainitgirllisa @beytannies Ran here to defend jisoo as soon as you saw the word ""talentless""?? Idk about you but that speaks VOLUMES about your favs🙁"
1578,"@BlinkforL Nah, if you had to come here on a 4 month old tweet and say “beyoncé recognized jisoo therefore she’s talented” it’s like you’re trying to convince armys that she’s not talentless, validation seeking ass 😭"
1579,@bluengreyx Tweet abt Beyoncé only recognizes talent and blinkue uses it as a validation for Jisoo after got wished in her birthday. Where tf talentless came from?
1580,@ChuJenChaeli0T4 @mainitgirllisa @beytannies The twt is literally shading the talentless and ur fandom was like not jisoo 🤣🤣

2665,they wanna own bullying scandals what happened to feeling bad for soojin and garam
2666,like knetz have bullied soojin far more than she ever even allegedly bullied anyone herself. they’re crazy
2667,does anyone else think its real hypocritical when kpop stans harras l idols for being 'bullies' (garam and soojin) but literally every kpop stan is just a bully who hides behind a screen https://t.co/63yMd12mny
2668,"we get garam and soojin who just got accused of bullying which are proven FALSE and got kicked out on their own group

meanwhile you debuted these ANIMALS who are ACTUAL BULLIES to their what? a co-member on their group? INSANE."
2669,"@yqsleftpinkytoe agree. Her fandom is just sadfishing all the time and brainwashing people to make them believe yuqi has been really mistreated. One of the things they did is saying yuqi is elbow out but the rest of the group, and said she was bullied by soojin (this went on top search in C-media"
2670,“worry about soojin being a bully” R U TRYING TO TELL ME U THINK LUCAS IS A BETTER PERSON THAN SOOJIN.
2671,"all these other idols faced bullying accusations, got away with it, but soojin has to leave gidle just for the “victim” to admit that she saw soojin get harassed, receive death threats? shinae feels “unsure” of everything? none of this bullshit is adding up"
2672,what gets me the most about this situation is that soojin was proven by her classmates to not even be involved in most of these baseless accusations and those accusing her keep poking holes in their own stories like... my girl was innocent but still had to pay the price
2673,"@Jay82192157 @RYLCmeiw0 U think what a bunch of k-idiots do is defined by the entire fd? Seunghan was bullied by k-briize, garam was humiliated by k-fearnots n Soojin was not supported by their own k-fanbase. Itzy is one controversy away from disbanding the way the noms don't add up anymore."
2674,ugly crying because i just got reminded that soojins family were so scared she might take her life that they moved in with their aunt and when she moved in she did nothing but cry and skip meals. my sweet girl. the world owes you an apology.

Soojin denied the mistreatments and only agreed that a phone argument had happened, for which she had already apologized about. https://t.co/eh3H9imYM3"
2676,@nothing4kpop She isn’t wtf are you talking about. The ppl who accused her were all found out to be one person pretending to be different ppl. The actress literally said she didn’t actually know if soojin was in the group that bullied her.
2677,The one who insinuated that soojin bullied her does not want to be associated with SJ and the fandom anymore? Why start all this mess then if you're not going to follow through. People lost interest bc you had nothing and was just clout chasing.
2678,"Do we not remember what happened to Garam? Soojin? So many people try to ruin female idols’ careers by falsely accusing them of bullying. Hell, someone even accused Soyeon of bullying to try to ruin her career even though she was HOMESCHOOLED."
2679,"Baek Soojin is the only daughter to her parents, she grew up in a quiet home but outside was anything but peaceful. Thought high school she was bully by a number of girls due to her body weight. Naturally being bullied made her reserved and timid, weary of people and pessimistic."
2680,@idlecharts The soojin references in the video make me think the man  also represent the kpop fans that  bullied soojin.
2681,"@idleis6 cause it's rlly just so nonsensical &amp; inhumane, not to mention it can very easily be one of our faves, esp gidle, netizens have found reason to hate since debut &amp; evem kicked soojin out due to false bullying rumors bc mfs were mad that the girl they bullied became successful 😭"
2682,"@fromisnot9 shes saying that soojin wasnt the sole reason the group was successful, the same ppl who said that bullied her out of the group, considering she also said soojinnie rather than soojin + multiple songs made with her mind its super unlikely to be shade"
2683,@itzyforlifer Exactly like I think about Soojin all the time it was so unfair. Though I do get that it’s a bigger issue in their schools and there are probably a myriad of ways kids get bullied there that I never experienced so it’s not uncalled for but like you said it’s so easy to dogpile

2686,"Not one media source was found defending Soojin, 12 year old Soojin was being slut-shamed and harassed by grown adults for doing teenage things such as trying to smoke, dressing trendy, and cussing. Mind you, this was what she was mostly attacked for, not being an alleged bully."
2687,well....after soojin and garam we learned something about korean bullies:  the bully plays the victim card and comes out in the exactly moment their victim are about to live their dream life. dont trust until theres a actual answer from court.
2688,"@mccnlightaria Don't assume things.  Just because there is an accusation doesn't mean it's true. Being nugu doesn't even matter here. It's ""innocent until proven guilty"" and she also said she hasn't bullied anyone so please try to learn something from the garam n soojin case"
2689,yet soojin had her entire career ruined for bullying ACCUSATIONS be so fr right now
2690,"how hypocritical you all are. you remember about soojin and what happened to her only when it is convenient for you, but when soojin was at the center of ridicule and bullying you all happily supported it by liking dirty tweets"
2691,"can we talk about how knetz probably hated soojin not just bc of her bullying allegations but bc she stood up for herself? what enraged them the most is that they never made her bend to their will, instead, she held her head up high and refused to apologize for shit she didn't do"
2692,You know the people accusing her could ALSO be her bully? You said bullying is nasty in Korea but you don't think these bullies would go so far to destroy someone career? Is it too much to ask for common sense?? You did this for soojin for garam and now this ?
2693,everyone bullied them into leaving the group and i didn’t see soojin for years. no trace. no one could give an update about her. i kept on wondering if she will ever go back on being an idol again because I REALLY MISS HER.

3078,“ADOR is doing things legally” ADOR made Hanni visa status publicly(without Hanni consent) known and offset relentlessly abuse from your fandom calling for her deportation. They release statements to crack down on NJZ activity and disguise it as doing it “for the fans”. Spare me.

3087,The first chat was presented by ADOR. The second chat was presented by Team NJZ. BOTH chats confirm that illit told their manager that they would ignore Hanni.

3088,"Lets be clear. The May 28th CCTV footage was STILL YET TO BE RELEASED. Releasing the May 27th footage was pure media play to defame Hanni and NJZ. The fact that they cannot present the May 28th footage says it all

3103,hybe setting up njz for mass hate but hanni using her critical judgement to make the right decision is teaching me valuable life lessons. do not trust people at work 😭😭 thank you hanni
3104,"ador's argument so far:

1. hybe invested 21 billion krw to njz so njz success must be credited to hybe
2. hanni took the ""ignoring"" incident lightly
3. mhj was behind the actions of njz
4. KMJ (ador ceo) ""i watch njz video every day""
5. KMJ ""i really want to work with you"" https://t.co/9Wm0q9Reto"
3105,"when njz brings up other groups, it's important to note that it's about IMPORTANT CONTEXT IN THEIR MISTREATMENT. they are not blaming the groups. they do not hate the groups. they are just stating what happened in the timeline of events because of HYBE."
3106,hybe stans acting like hybe wanting to stop the girls from performing is something new or a “consequence of their actions” like they weren’t planning to put the girls on an almost 2 year hiatus if they had stayed.. erasing and replacing newjeans was always their plan. https://t.co/wb0zanmeYW

3110,"Hybe said that NJZ would debut as ‘Hybe’s first girl group’ 
Not only they were promised to debut first, to add insult to the injury, Hybe themselves doesn’t want mhj to promote the girls until lsfm was out, if this is not discriminatory from the get go idk what is. https://t.co/Xmpqzheyrq"
3111,"Journalistic malpractice.

The texts NJZ presented show Hanni recalling the incident w/ ILLIT's manager consistently &amp; in her own words.

3523,basically what i’m understanding is that they’re saying kim garam is a victim even during a school violence committee even when she’s categorized as the ASSAILANT on a case that wasn’t categorized as bullying but ASSAULT because she was fighting a “friend”.
3524,but wouldn't that friend have filed a report against the victim if this were true? Bullying records only exist for Kim Garam and not for the victim from what we know
3525,"if kim garam is not guilty then fight for her, prove it! dah jadi company besar pun bodoh kee ? cube tu boleh citer la shitty company, kecik, artis pun tk rmai cam kau. learn from jyp for once, fight for hyunjin &amp; kick a trainee for bullying issue."
3526,you're telling me the school has a record of kim garam for bullying but no record of yoo eunseo RECORDING basically CHILD PORNOGRAPHY and uploading it on a public site? make it make sense

4296,"I'm afraid that Kim Garam will never be allowed to live her dream. There is a big anti-bullying push in South Korea now; and it looks like they are going to use Kim Garam as their poster child. He'll, she's still a minor! Where are her lawyers?!"

well, why didn't the accuser go to an adult if Garam was bullying her? she even went to meet Garam on her own w/o any fear. that's right, bc the accuser is the actual bully and Garam was merely responding to her hateful actions."
4299,@pastas_and_wine @Koreaboo There’s huge difference between bullying and calling out some one bullying is an habitual action that happened without reasons but calling out is happen once because the other side is at wrong stop justifying the injustice and hate garam got

4313,What I understand from garam’s case is that people can be so mean bullying minor over baseless accusations spreading rumours and misinformations about without her side of story or even sharing it as they did with the accuser but never have the audacity to apologise to her
4314,"My Monday morning hot take is. 

Kim Garam was used by Source Music to promote LSF. Source did fuck all to protect n safeguard their employee when K-netizens bullied the shit out of Garam, a 16y/o girl, for allegedly bullying others.

4317,@krisdinetwt You mentioned her first !it’s ok to spread misinformation about her and bullying her calling her evil but it’s a problem when we defend ?
4318,I don’t know anything about his case but them talking horribly about his look rather than the actual issue and also bully both garam and Giselle while they have nothing to do with him and they want to convince us they are anti bullying ? They’re all piece of trash
4319,Forever thinking the way people treated Kim Garam during the bullying scandal was absolutely horrendous and gross as fuck
4320,@fifty_fifty_fan People don’t really care about bullying or the real victims or any other issues they just wanna hate on everyone while pretending they’re the good side here they actually have that superiority complex towards those celebrities cus they’re losers in real life

4326,@jjktheaceking This is ain’t about K-pop anymore you seriously need help mocking a dead person who end her life due to bullying and manifesting death to someone you had never met you really need to see a doctor
4327,I feel like most bullying cases are more like how Kim Garam’s was where there is a nuance to the idols “bullying”. Where it’s most likely retaliation from a bully.
4328,@jiwoosprite look at the kim garam situation bullying is a VERY serious accusation
4329,hyunjin is ugly as fuck and the bullying allegations of him and kim garam are true
4330,for example when lesserafim had a press conference they asked about bullying allegations to kim garam and they can't answer. korean reporters are so brutal when it comes to that
4331,I've noticed most fearnots were afraid that time. The fandom has just started so its normal. I think it was other fandoms who trynna make it seems theyre concern for cw&amp;skr just to shit on garam. Theres also other bullying stuffs that was compared to make their faves clean.
4332,Anyways Kim Garam is  better then me because if you posted CHILD 🌽 of my friend I was going to bring back  REAL BULLYING

4334,not 100% whether he was proven guilty or not but this tweets point (mostly) still stands. kim garam was cleared of her bullying allegations and was defending her friend but still was kicked out of her group because no one believed her despite the proof she gave.
4335,It's so infuriating that a young promising idol like Kim Garam got her dream destroyed with false bullying accusations while this fucking prick gets a 2nd chance. This industry is fucked.

4362,no one bringing up kim garam but but I just think both companies (which is ironic since seunghan was in soumu) handled it very poorly at not considering their specific cases. You want to clear and clarify something with bullying allegations asap. You want to act fast for leaks.
4363,@userbfIy They are trained from elementary school on bullying and manupulating . HYBE is no great. They acted so badly on KIM GARAM and removed her too
4364,@pannchoa Even ex Le Sserafim Kim Garam don't trying to get sympathy after kicked from HYBE after 2 month of debut... While Riize Seunghan kept in haitus for years and thinking he can get away with him dating a minor and bullying Eunchae.

4566,@soompi there's enough evidence that hyunjoo is not lying and yena and her sister were caught trying to defame hyunjoo and it backfired on her and her group this is actually shameful from their company
4567,"Lost all respect for her.
HyunA stan stop saying ""FREE HER"" when he is biggest asshole and he also was involved in Burning Sun scandal which was one of the biggest scandals in Korea. He admitted is involvement. HyunaA also knew it but still hung out with these type peoples🤐 https://t.co/ltCvKVDTEE"

Hyune who has a hole collection of bn pictures and hates hates HATES the idol he has to protect goes as far as creating a scandal so that he can free bnnie :("
4576,"If u still support the people of the Burning Sun scandal and Hyuna, tbh u need professional help, cause wtf bro"
4577,Hey so ummm friendly reminder for gg Stans… women aren’t always free from scandal either. Do I need to remind y’all about Hyuna orrrrrrr………..
4578,"I pray for the downfall of everyong involved in burning sun scandal,  including fcking digusting hyuna and fcking ugly boyfriend"
4579,"yall just eat his shit up.. neutral on the palestinian genocide, friends with hyuna and only apologised for posting abt her when he was publicly called out. hyunas relationship with a criminal was widely covered in korean media nevermind the international coverage. he knew."
4580,"Ngl at first watch at this pic i thought he was aking about ""hyuna"" and her situation/scandal after doing an f u sign at ig to her haters 🤣🤣🤣"
4581,what's most annoying is some hyuna accs that weren't at all active around the time of the scandal and haven't posted anything ab it so ofc i didn't unfollow or smth and now they decide to start being active and flood my page with hyuna content like?? get away i don't wanna know
4582,"disrespectful to hara as well, hara pushed the investigation of the burning sun scandal until her death &amp; hyuna being someone she was very close with has the audacity to marry a scum who was directly involved in it &amp; has ADMITTED to the crime"
4583,Rediscovering Dawn's music because of the Hyuna scandal and damn did I miss that man. So much talent and emotion now ready to be shared freely.
4584,"The worst thing about Hyuna publicly revealing her relationship with that man other than the obvious, is that she platforming him by publicizing their relationship, he’s been discussed more in the last 3 days that the last 5 years"
4585,yall dont care about the burning sun scandal if u hate hyuna more than her boyfriend
4586,Hyuna is not dating a man involved in the Burning Sun scandal. 😭
4587,He def has some parasocial relationship issues and is a wee bit cringe for that but putting him on a list together with the burning sun scandal man and hyuna is wild lmao
4588,ALSO i’m sick and tired of people blaming hyuna for this she didn’t do anything wrong cube were the ones that denied their relationship and then confirmed it not even an hour later they should have thought this through all hyuna did was tell the truth with hyojong’s permission!!!
4589,"And MIND YOU, this guy's Goo Hara's ex. The woman who helped uncover most of evidence in the burning sun scandal. And HYUNA AND Hara used to be BEST FRIENDS. This girl just became horrible, betraying her friend who's not alive, nd dawn who ruined his career for only her."
4590,Every person still defending and protecting those men involved in the burning sun scandal or hyuna is going to burn in hell
4591,"hyuna……. comment t’as pu tomber aussi bas ma fille??? on peut accepter la rupture avec hyojong mais alors l’annonce avec cette sous merde?? c’est non. 
elle sort avec un mec certifié d’avoir participé au scandale burning sun.. c’est la zinzinerie la?? loin de moi les deux"
4592,maybe the nastiest part (to me) of hyuna dating junhyung isn’t even that she made women’s rights her whole brand. it’s that he also dated her friend goo hara. goo hara was exploited by another ex in a similar fashion to burning sun victims.
4593,"Kaliwa't kanang batikos ang kinahaharap ngayon ng K-pop star na si HyunA pagkatapos niyang ianunsiyo ang nakatakda nilang pagpapakasal ng kapwa singer na si Yong Jun Hyung, na nasangkot noon sa Burning Sun scandal. Read more: https://t.co/hWB0fzuvo9 https://t.co/GOmo7UxmiI"
4594,"Finally, Hyuna starts to do something about this bullshit-burning sun scandal now. Because both of them have been kind to everyone and were silent when people spreading false information about them. Now it’s time for them to sue these Twitter and TikToker, who made fake news"
4595,"dawn was so misunderstood and it baffles me till this day that my it girl hyuna could leave that man, tell him he’s not marriage and get married to yong junhyung, the same man that was is a suspect of taking part in the burning sun scandal. what has love become? may my baby heal."
4596,"led dawn on for 6 years, he left his company for her, only for her to desert him and marry a burning sun scandal man. 

hyuna is a JOKE."
4597,Infelizmente a Hyuna conseguiu destruir uma das carreiras mais solidificadas da Coreia por causa de um pervertido nojento
4598,putting the pinks next to hyuna and men from the burning sun scandal… LIKE BE SERIOUS
4599,first thing that comes up when u google burning sun scandal is about hyuna lolzor
4600,hyuna losing her career and her friends because of her own choice of dating a sa
4601,hyuna bf recently post it on ig !  He says that he is not connected to the group chat or has anything to do with the video or scandal. So please stop hating on Hyuna just because you read fake news.
4602,"And you guys think this information handed by Hybe is not Defaming and not about MHJ? Told you they lied.  

https://t.co/c2YkDEx0js"
4603,To go from Dawn to this man involved in one of the biggest scandal seen in Korea … the fall of HyunA is just sad
4604,"HyunA wasn't ready to marry Dawn so she eventually ended her engagement with him, but she was quick to ready well-known sex offender Yong Junhyung from the Burning Sun Scandal? Something isn't right with this woman's mind and I need everyone to continue NOT supporting her."
4605,watching hyolyn and hyuna downfall in real time. People just wont treat hyolyn the same after the N word and zi*nist scandal
4606,"yeah, a lot of people also seem to forget that the main reason they revealed it was because of rumors starting that hyuna was sex*ally a*saulting dawn and hui (during triple h promotions) 

so proud of how far they’ve all come since that day.. 😭💜"
4607,"Yong Junhyung, who is being called out amid the ""Burning Sun"" documentary, finally spoke out and revealed the ""true story"" behind his involvement in the scandal. 

#YongJunhyung #HyunA #BurningSun https://t.co/FFn3xylp1Q"
4608,people really think the public was supportive of hyuna and hyojong. it was either hyojong was ruining his career before it even started or hyuna was praying on young men or they were both intentionally trying to destroy ptg.
4609,"mind you, we are not talking about some minor scandal no one knows about. this man was involved in what's probably one of the biggest scandals involving the korean entertainment industry so there's NOTHING that can justify hyuna holding hands with him like that"
4610,"I've seen a lot of talk recently about minors debuting in kpop groups, which I think is an important convo. Hyuna debuted at the age of 14 and theres a lot of troubling things.

Firstly, she had severe depression and suicidal thoughts at 14 due to leaving JYP for her health."
4611,"Why is Lisa not being treated the same as Hyuna, even though they're both dating awful people?"
4612,"If anyone still supports Hyuna, unfollow me or block me. She's fucking stupid to marry a man involved in a scandal that only involved him getting a slap on the wrist. She had it so good with Dawn, 6 years with him, but said she wasn't ready to marry...  but chooses to marry +"
4613,marrying her deceased bsf's ex who was INVOLVED IN THE BURNING SUN SCANDAL and her bsf had revealed who most men involved in the scandal were. FUCK HYUNA FUCK THE BURNING SUN SCANDAL DAWN YOU ROCK HYUNA YOU FLOP
4614,"for kpop stans, this is like hyuna getting together with that bitch who was included in the sun scandal and her morals leaving her body"
4615,"I totally agree with this but just to be sure, Hyuna is dating a bystander of the burning sun scandal (not defending him bc he's still shit but just to not spread misinformation (even if I want to bc he's still an ass))"
4616,ppl going on and on abt not dragging haras name into this when she was one of the main reasons this scandal was brought to light…her bravery isnt being reduced here. though her and hyuna werent best friends hyuna still had to have known abt the shit this man did!!
4617,how did hyuna groom someone 2 years younger adult? gen question — from my understanding of the situation it had less to do w/ age and more to do w/ the power imbalance of being an alr debuted idol vs being...  https://t.co/C4OO1lvE5g
4618,I don’t understand the kpop stans fuckery at how they mocked soyeon and hwasa for writing feminist lyrics but literally stanned hyuna JUST because she marketed herself as a feminist and now proceeded to date a man involved in burning sun scandal
4619,"@hyunchanstay Literally. It was fishy and she got exposed for ssg behaviour but since she isn't korean, they made excuses for her. Now I don't wanna see or hear any support for her"
4620,im not defending Hyuna in any way but its always the female artists that get the worst treatment after a scandal even when its the man’s fault
4621,"saying that hyuna and her husband, who is associated with the burning sun scandal, are beauty is not the gag you think it is"
4622,"i feel like y’all are forgetting that the burning sun scandal first broke the news in 2019. maybe y’all weren’t on here but you think the men weren’t scrutinized? this hyuna situation is recent, so of course it’s going to receive more coverage, especially on stan twitter."
4623,Ustedes entienden que según las kpopers hyuna era un icono feminista para que al final la mina se case con un tipo que confirmó ver videos de sus amigos v1iolando a otras mujeres https://t.co/jrtwjF8ape
4624,"Obviously he deserves more flack too but y’all are forgetting that this nigga was nawt even that famous B4 the Rising Sun scandal, meanwhile hyuna was a BELOVED idol for SO many years up until recently, of course she’s gonna get the brunt of the backlash out of the two 😭"
4625,Even JJY himself didn't get as much hate as Hyuna when the scandal broke out in 2019 y'all just love to pile on and bully women and feel you have a free card to do that now 💀
4626,"Nak bitter. Bitter sbb hyunA bercinta bertahun² dengan Dawn(he left his group Pentagon and company semata² nak stay dengan hyunA). Pastu bila Dawn proposed, hyunA kata tak ready.

Not so long after, she said “YES” to another man whom btw is a part of the BURNING SUN SCANDAL⁉️"
4627,“why am i not seeing the hate for the men in the burning sun scandal-“ idk maybe because we did the hate for them already fucking years ago when that all came out and now the hate for all of them is a given? and hyuna decided to get herself involved recently so she’s under fire?
4628,"the fact that this is her deceased ex best friends boyfriend too. Its like she is dancing on goo haras grave not caring for shit &amp; specially since hara was the one who got the burning sun scandal to light. hyuna you FUCKING SUCK. 

if any moots support hyuna. please block me."
4629,The recognition of Soyeon's ability is something her stans had to fight for. Her actual recognition relative to her contribution is the lowest in GIDLE and maybe in K-pop. Chef Sso and her IG lives this year showed how few actual dedicated fans of hers there are in Neverland. https://t.co/24YKbYsFfx
4630,"Agreed and cube is guilty for this, I bet they didn’t want to rely so heavily on an artist after Hyuna’s scandal, so they constantly sabotaged Sy’s solo career, no solo variety shows from her, editing her out of Italks, and the amount of pressure she is on to work or else"
4631,"2024.
the year of scandals and cancelation.
either if its k-pop, youtube germany/usa or Hollywood.

this year is so fucked up.
•Anni,Taddl,Unge
•Mr. Beast
•Michael jackson &amp; PDiddy.
•Hyuna &amp; Burning sun guy
•""Yoongi""(bffr thats wasnt a scandal)"
4632,he gets hate he’s just not as big or important as her she was THE idol at one point in time and she shaped her entire career off women and being a “girls girls” also he got his wave of hate when the bs scandal first happened. hyuna deserves EVERYTHING she’s getting rn PERIOD!
4633,why hyuna and dawn broke up is none of my business but she sucks so bad for making her entire brand about women empowerment and then going on and dating a man involved in the burning sun scandal. yikes
4634,armys are like “don’t say anything its still unconfirmed” the pretend nice neutral thing you lot going on while jimin’s name is linked to the scandal really truly shows yalls faces… you lots competition with jimin reached a point that yall want the hyuna treatment for him
4635,"this type of shit got me to stop stanning, but also i rlly hope people dont just turn against lisa and let the MAN face 0 consequences for financing the genocide, like y'all did with hyuna and that guy in the burning sun scandal"
4636,Just a reminder that when it all started it’s 200 articles that was written by media paid by Hybe to slander the girls and out of them at least 100 were about Hyein phoning updates being distorted most of them posted the day of #this group debut . She went through so much pain https://t.co/KAt8yut0Dv
4637,i get people saying why would people be more focused on hating on hyuna over the other men who were actually involved on the burning sun scandal but i don’t think it’s even that people hate her more. it’s just that people feel fucking betrayed! you’re a woman why the fuck are
4638,hyuna pisses me off so bad how are gonna be like “i don’t wanna get married” then marry the mf from the burning sun scandal. be fucking serious.
4639,hyuna actively dates a man involved in the burning sun scandal and is pick me hypocrite maybe we should direct hate towards ppl who deserve it so
4640,"you must not be active on kpop, bro. you should've seen the way people cancelled hyuna because she's dating someone who got involved in sexual assault controversy. even her biggest fanbase left her, and that's how it should be. principles, man, principles."
4641,hyuna literally went from dawn to this down… it’s crazy when a feminist like her is getting married to a person who is first her best friend’s ex and is involved in such a vile case as he watched videos of multiple women getting raped. be embarrassed mr and mrs burning sun
4642,"""why hyuna is getting hate when junhyung's the only one who did the crime?""

she chose him. she proudly posted a man on her ig with million of followers that she knew to be guilty of enabling and enjoying women being sexually assaulted and abused.

it's honestly disgusting."
4643,hyuna is marrying someone who was involved in the worst rape scandal to ever hit the korean entertainment industry yet somehow everyone in the qrts is acting like her EX MAN is the main victim here
4644,"hyuna is so messed up for dating junhyung like not only was he involved in that terrible chat room burning sun scandal, but he was the ex of hyuna's friend hara. hara who was a big help in exposing the scandal &amp; the men as she had went through similar horror. this is so so sick"
4645,her dating a guy involved in the burning sun scandal it’s a joking matter? someone that admitted openly to enjoy watching girls getting r worded?? yeah fuck hyuna
4646,"to people who don’t actually know hyuna and don’t follow her career that have the audacity to try and spread misinformation from an article that suspected a former gg member of selling drugs when they haven’t confirmed ANY idol, let me give you some insight: https://t.co/0HuWLtMkqE"

4650,"worry about jennie smoking.. but hyuna is marrying someone involved in the burning sun scandal, jay park opened an only fans, people cheered when wonho showed his balls, bts also smokes, the entirety of super junior, lucas &amp; woojin still having a fanbase.. like come on😭"
4651,"for people confused about what’s going on: hyuna is dating a man named junhyung who is a known participant of the burning sun scandal, which was an extremely public sexual abuse case in korea. there is no way she doesn’t know he was involved because of how publicized this was. https://t.co/4h7VQk6zfH"

4656,like hes been getting hate since the scandal broke thats forever stuck with him. hyuna claims to be a feminist but started dating a sex offender that also use to date her deceased best friend who help exposed the scandal he’s involved in. so she deserves hate tbh

There’s no excuse for hyuna at all and if I see anyone defending her I’m blocking you immediately. How could she willingly and knowingly date someone who was involved in burning sun. A man who gladly watched videos of women and minors be SAed"

6527,NJZ’s having multiple fandoms obsessed with them is kinda tea idk
6528,Hybe sued the victim even they weren't the one who exposed garam it was another party but Kim garam bully gang thought it was victim A who did it so they published their photos and made fun of her this made victim mental health worse and they try to end their life! SICKKK PPL
6529,"i really can’t believe they came up with ""according to kim garam"" with no solid proofs, still claiming she’s the victim and saying she’s going on hiatus bc of her mental health ...  this is the worst statement ever like pls delete this is embarrassing #garam_out"
6530,"not txt related, but just my thoughts on the kim garam situation

i've done the research, i've fact checked every single accusation, and based on the evidence and proof we currently have, garam is NOT a bully. she at least deserves to get her name cleared.

6531,@joonie_7bts @lknoeasy Kim Garam is a member of Hybe &amp; Source Music’s new gg Lessarafim. She has multiple school violence and bullying accusations against her with proof as well as a restraining order.
6532,"1. Garam was never really proven innocent and her fans made it up with fake documents. FALSE!

Garam used her close friend, Yurim’s Instagram account to not only release official documents to prove her innocence, but to also reach out to the general public and her fans in 2022."
6533,"The way all of ran with a manipulated SVC well here you go, Garam isn’t afraid and knows her truth. She shared the whole SVC without cutting like Eunseo who manipulated and outsmarted dumb kpoppies who didn’t question shit.

6534,"1. Kim Garam's ex dance team mate speak up

- Garam used to quarel with seniors a lot
- There was once Garam opposing dance team agreement to practice 4 times (pic 3 chat)

The pfp of that chat is likely Kim Garam bcs the background is similar to her friend pics in mid sch (pic4) https://t.co/uJLJBTSEwS"
6535,"the reason why kim garam isn't an idol anymore is because  you kpop stans are guillible as fuck and will sympathize with the victim without enough proofs BECAUSE YOU WANT A PUNCHING BAG !
you're the reason a 16 year olds dream was destroyed"
6536,"2. Kim Garam allegedly has once posted her school violence record on NAVER Question feature (자식인)

She asked:
- will it affect the acceptance if she applied to art school?
- is it worth to erase the level of punishment she received? https://t.co/QqvIZ4PV4b"
6537,Garam really lost her hard work and dreams because of kakao pushing the malicious rumors and not the articles were she was defended instead spread the fake ones.
6538,"HYBE failed to protect Garam, several articles sexualised her (she was a minor). It was recently exposed that HYBE has been threatening several reporters into deleting articles that are not in favour of them. If they have so much control, why didn’t they help clear Garam’s name?"
6539,"no it’s called human decency. if my new neighbour’s house is on fire, should i not help them because i don’t know them? garam’s mental health, career and image have been destroyed because of a useless company and kpop stans."
6540,"garam's victim is asking for public apology and if she gives that, what happens next? she promotes with le sserafim like nothing happened? no, knetz will not forgive her nor leave her alone and obviously, her group's reputation for the gp is tarnished as well, and for good."
6541,let it sink in to everyone that garam auditioned to become an idol the same year she was bullying the victim and received disciplinary action for it. It's not about whether she changed or not. It's about whether she has some shame and conscience or not.

6571,"the truth is that the bullying/sexual harassment towards garam will always be unwarranted like all this energy towards a 16 yr old girl for what she did when she was 12 is insane. not even seungri, actual criminals, &amp; grown ass idols got this much backlash from kpop stans."
6572,i will never forget the person who tweeted that bvlly!ng is cool when kim garam's controversy was the talk of the town.
6573,ok but ppls “hate” for kim garam kinda highlights the weird obsession people have with witch-hunting when it comes to bullying controversy. the way they bullies and harassed a 16 year old girl over false allegations even though they knew her for 17 days. so humanity = obsession?
6574,i want to take this time to say fuck all of you freaks that participated in the harassment of kim garam. she was so scared and you did nothing but hate on and demonise her when she DID NOT BULLY ANYONE. we’ve been saying this for months and you didn’t want to listen.

7351,this is 100% weird but i do in my heart wanna think that njz is were really trying to protect their juniors but they did it in such a selfish way that it brought upon hate towards their juniors and seniors also supporting mhj is definitely their biggest mistake

7363,i believe that regardless of outcome njzs biggest mistake was villainizing their colleagues while encouraging their nasty fans now i lost all respect for them and will side eye those who support them bc it's clear they don't really see lesserafim and illit as people
7364,This is sickening. Why are they ignoring the statements and deliberate attempts to damage NJZ such as the PR employee that was exposed? Canceling their world tour and fan meeting? Wanting to put them on hiatus for almost 2 years? That doesn’t constitute contract breach?

8330,this whole taeil controversy still makes me wonder why women from western countries see SK/Asian countries like a dreamland. The first ever full on feminist movement happened in SK of last year. Why would you actively see 4B taking place and STILL look for a male lover in Korea?
8331,I better not see any victim blaming in all these taeil controversy. Tolerating &amp; justifying his act is just like doing the act itself. Stop giving these offenders excuses.
8332,Taeil is the last person I imagined would be involved in ANY controversy let alone one of this gravity. I've been an NCTzen since 2016 and I am incredibly shocked and disgusted by this news and from what I'm seeing NO ONE including the members and the people close to taeil-

8467,"@purinzfem Isn't this because his contract isn't up yet, if they fire him they'll have to pay out his contract and give him a shit ton of money and nobody wants that loser to be rich. It's better to let his contract run so he can be poor in prison"
8468,@purinzfem How many times to do we have to tell you fuckers to stop associating  Lucas with the dickhead istg he will NEVER be the predator you want him to be! y'all don't care about the actual victims but love using them and mentioning a criminal along with Lucas to get your point across
8469,"@purinzfem im a lsfm stan but youre wrong about two things 
1) lucas and taeil are not the same
2) taeil is only employed bec they are avoiding the contract termination charges i believe his contract is ending soon"
8470,@purinzfem the difference between him &amp; lucas is lucas was not investigated for anything at ALL because there were no evidence stating his allegations were true. but yeah sure keep dragging someone just to defend your fave as if thats gonna make a difference

8473,"@kooknwjnss it also makes no sense bc no one is defending taeil?? he was kicked out of the group, he had to priv his instagram, he's literally UNDER INVESTIGATION and will likely have to appear in court, everyone knows ?? what more awareness can we bring to this than whats already occurring?"

8700,"I’m 110% convinced rbw is trying to destroy Hwasa confidence &amp; not in just her self but in everything she does that they have their hands in. From them putting no effort into her comeback, denying shows on her behalf, to sabotaging gifts fans send to her to show her she’s loved."

Her visual? She is being acknowledged as world beauty standards, korean beauty standards, the most beautiful woman

Singing ability?her solo become viral in sns, the longest solo debut kpop stay in many music platforms

YG so lucky to have her"
8974,"jisoo’s impact and influence are unmatched. no one can reach jisoo’s level and it’s pretty obvious that everyone realized how big her popularity is. she’s called “the most powerful ambassador”, she didn’t come to play 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/OwZPTHOxAP"
8975,"it's the way jisoo bagged so many awards without even promoting flower, like she had 2 stages and dipped. she's really has the gp on a chokehold omg"
8976,"I  remember 2018 and how btches would say jisoo isn't marketable enough and sht just for her to turn out to be top influencer, always generating highest emvs, selling million albums, bagging high end campaigns and booking multiple projects at a time"
8977,"Jisoo broke almost all female Soloist Records with her unprompted album, that's what she is capable of she doesn't need yg or any big brand to climb the success ladder it's the other way around 🤷‍♀️"
8978,"I am sorry but Jisoo would never be the flop soloist they want her to be. She has had the most successful solo debut in 2023 &amp; served as a pathbreaker on various platforms. Mind you she did exceptionally well in YT, with their new change algorithm, some idols can only dream of. https://t.co/DzUWi1HNIQ"
8979,"Jisoo without the need of hanging on someone's else success, no promo at all, no collabs, no multiple version of the same song, an album fully in Korean yet she managed to succeed what a Queen 👑"
8980,"Thinking about Jisoo is the first k-pop idol to grace The Big Four of Vogue cover, the first blackpink member to be on BoF500 list,  constantly topped PFW for 3 years consecutively. Her influences in fashion is acknowledged by professionals, proud is an understatement."
8981,"I really can’t 😂😂 successful where? Jisoo is the highest selling female  K-pop soloist in history, the first and only female K-pop soloist to become a million seller, the highest peaking Korean female soloist on Spotify, has the highest debut streams in a day for a female K-pop https://t.co/7oqCmKsmCW"
8982,"The fact that Jisoo has surpassed BP charts (when we all know how at the top they are) should tell u she's amazing as an artist. It shall make u feel proud &amp; glad a member from the most prominent kpop gg is doing wonders with just two songs, not make u whine like a petulant child"
8983,"ill always be proud of jisoo's organic growth and how she's never benefited from nepotism. despite being bp's most mistreated member and sabotage from YG, she worked her way up with her brands from being local ambassador to fashion muse to double GA. the only woman ever."
8984,JISOO is the GOAT of if your boyfriend is a jisoo Stan just know you're second https://t.co/HkN2tIpE4X
8985,JISOO’s stability is so insane y’all don’t understand both in global and in sk she is pulling the same exact numbers she was pulling like wdym she is getting 3M streams daily since day two up to now and she is #2 in every major sk chart despite the new releases
8986,Jisoo is the highest charting kpop soloist in top songs daily chart on Spotify so please if you want her to stay at top keep streaming please https://t.co/1mgemJSUQv
8987,"of course jisoo is the most successful and the biggest visual kpop has ever had. who among kpop visuals have double global ambassadorship when it comes to luxury goods, jewelry, electronics, even athleisure wear? send her abroad and she still makes history. a real bankable woman. https://t.co/0PPZFry46N"
8988,"Nah Jisoo is something else, to start with she already takes the stage as the most beautiful woman ever, smiling all the time, having the time of her life and conveying it to the crowd, singing flawlessly with little to no backtrack, no missing a beat, no missing a move, like WOW"
8989,"Jisoo joining Blackpink and BTS as the only artists to top Circle/Gaon monthly charts while her competition was 3rd and 4th gen groups, soloists, sub-units and collabs, sales matching streams globally and locally insane viralism, korea's new national anthem with no promo 😭"
8990,"I feel like I'm not actually processing the magnitude of Jisoo's accomplishments right now, she's breaking charts and sales records so fast, She is breaking the records of other artists, of her members, achieving things that no female artist has ever achieved before, like... WOW"
8991,kinda crazy how jisoo as the most neglected member of a group that barely has music is the most awarded soloist of the year and is the ONLY female million selling soloist 😭 she gets so much hate on a daily but there's no one coming close to her achievements
8992,"Koreans are really sentimental for idols that often promoting in their own country or abroad. Jisoo rarely got local brands or appeared in local tv shows, not even had a performance stage yet but her domestic charts are beyond expectations. She’s an organic korean sweetheart."
8993,"when it comes to visuals, stable vocals, choreography, &amp; perfection - KIM JISOO wins that undoubtedly, and everyone knows that. she's god tier, she's UNREAL i'm afraid 🤯"
8994,let me remind you that it wasn't jennie jisoo or jaehyun having their company get an encore deleted and re-upload pitch-corrected one because they were getting clowned left and right for sounding like a goat on its last breath 😭
8995,"Honestly considering how in demand jisoo is she’s still so down to earth,humble and kind. Fame hasn’t changed her since day one, she’s even more confident now, glad to have her as my bias.She really wasn’t joking when she said “I choose my future self as my role model” yes queen."
8996,"anyway, jisoo will never be the flop you want her to be. she has had way less opportunities than the other three and yet she can still go head to head with them, no matter how many times you call her a hag or add -soo to a word. she already has and always will come out on top 🤷‍♀️"
8997,"Jisoo's success as a soloist is unparalleled, streams, awards, and charts matching, no remixes, no versions, and no promo, nothing fishy, nothing questionable, just good music, the support of her fans, the support of the global population and above all her talent"
8998,"jisoo has the most amazing market pull out of all the bp members. she has no solo songs out, least lines, least screentime, gigs always blocked but still thriving with followers, charts and, every beauty or brand ranking and she's not even the least in engagements like wow 🤍"
8999,"That’s simple, Jisoo is popular though YG mistreated her. FYI, she’s koreans favorite, they’re always looking forward to her projects but YG never gave her the spotlight she deserved. Years passed but everytime YG had to give her projects (reluctantly), koreans still love her https://t.co/iUelY12QTZ"

9013,"After finding time to listen to AMORTAGE , I can finally give my opinion but :

9029,It’s a good thing that Jungkook’s fans didn’t vote for this show. He was literally forced to participate in it while promoting his solo album. And why should we vote for another member’s show when their fans turned Jungkook’s solo debut into a nightmare—spreading lies + https://t.co/GcrTlFPUBx
9030,I learned in 2019 that the Lamoiyan Corporation employs people with disabilities and provides college scholarships to deaf-mute people in addition to employing Filipinos and directly contributing to our national economy.
9031,Different articles and different topics but today Korean media has praised Jungkook highlighting him as ‘HISTORY MAKER’ for a new record on Spotify and ‘GLOBAL POP STAR’ for his nominations on Music Awards Japan. He deserves those praises so much✨ https://t.co/pR6uF5ZNIV
9032,"jungkook could go to any girl group's concert and their fans will ALWAYS say he came for a specific member. doesn't matter if its aespa, BP, lsrfm, twice, etc. he's shipped with at least one girl from every group which is why i cannot take any of them seriously https://t.co/fqYBS03oUv"

9034,"the way jimin can win a fan vote award the same way jungkook can win a fan vote award by himself too, but they couldn’t win when it’s the two of them together says a lot about this fandom. y’all hate seeing them together, and it shows."
9035,"Dragging her unprovoked because Jungkook went to their concert is so weird. Y’all are so desperate to create drama where there is none. And btw, she dances well—stop setting him up.....
https://t.co/DJK15VAP1q"
9036,my roman empire is the fact that namjoon was known for not being that great with physical contact but he only closed his eyes after jungkook hugged him https://t.co/AXklbpFPeo
9037,"I don’t like how everything Jungkook does get manipulated and overthought by everyone and by everyone not just armys but other fandoms joined too, let that man breath and have fun omg https://t.co/7clBUMRsi5"
9038,"Jungkook just needs to breathe to make everyone go crazy. He showed up fully covered, simply attended the concert at the end, left earlier, &amp; just sat there vibing without even trying to attract attention. Yet,became the most talked-about idol on every platform since yesterday. https://t.co/NOEbu74aiz"
9039,"remember when jungkook went to the masked singer because he wanted to break the stereotype that BTS is only good at rapping not singing.

as the main vocalist he felt responsible and he proved them all wrong with his stellar vocals like their reactions says it all. https://t.co/8sYZFlyqcS"
9040,"💜 :“would you love me if I were a bug?”

9057,"Kim Soohyun's PR team let Sulli take the heat during Real while he was away from the military. Let Seo Yeaji's career downfall to coverup issues in Gold Medalist, groomed Saeron and forced to the edge and now using Choi Hyunwook since #MyDearestNemesis is the most buzzworthy https://t.co/RK99P4Dz1v"
9058,"We need to have a convo about the people who've attacked Hyeri, Soojin, BIBI, etc. They're the same people that dogpiled other Korean women who've lost their lives because of it. Sulli, Goo Hara, now Sae Ron. The dragging culture must END, it IS an active component of e-murder."
9059,"[BREAKING NEWS] Sulli dikabarkan telah meninggal dunia
.
Senin (14/10) Berdasarkan laporan Yonhap News, Sulli ditemukan telah meninggal dunia di kediamannya, Seongnam, Korea Selatan. Mantan anggota girl group f(x) ini ditemukan meninggal oleh manajernya … https://t.co/RHNYBh99nt https://t.co/5adv5u7TCI"
9060,"Fuck it really hurts. Jonghyun, Sulli, Hara, Moonbin, Wheesung... I saw them all on stage. And they've all passed at a young age. As much as I love the music, I hate how the industry mentally and physically takes a toll on people. They do not get enough rest."
9061,This was the same treatment people gave to Sulli. Suddenly everyone include her haters and her ex fandom acted like they've always been supportive of her and started a pity party. It's always disgusting watching how people wash their hand so fast and act innocent.
9062,"Please stop asking this about the girls, they would just be reminded about the heartbreak of losing someone they dearly love and  it's obvious the moment sulli's name was mentioned the hurt was very evident in amber's eyes."
9063,"Kim Saeron,Sulli,Seo Yeaji,Song Hye Kyo suffered so much due to baseless rumors when they were not even at fault.Mass hated and boycotted.
BUT
Seungri,  Taeil,  Yoo Ah in ,these Korean men can easily disappear for 1 year and continue to live life as they want. 
WHY ALWAYS WOMEN!?"
9064,"#Sulli's brother stated he's called lawyer to get things done with their father. Earlier, her brother was enraged as their father suddenly called him, talking bad about their mother and stated he had visited Sulli's grave https://t.co/FZiiEECEbY #KoreanUpdates VF https://t.co/SZyP8WGZ7g"
9065,"This is heart breaking to ask. Sulli went through a lot with hate comments about the t her looks, her body, her personality, her dating, etc. When Sulli left f(x) I was shocked but whatever made her happy. Fx members tried but they can't control everything. Everything was a shock"
9066,what if we just stop speculating on sulli altogether instead of implying anything played a role because none of us know her or how she felt
9067,"BUT U DIDNT SAY ""have we forgotten about Sulli, Goo Hara,etc?"" WHEN THE MEDIA BACKLASH KIM SAERON???
U LITERALLY CRITIQUE EVERYTHING SHE DID EVEN WHAT SHE DID JUST TO SURVIVE???

Its okay for kim soo hyun to die. At least we decreasing the number of predator. I said what i said."
9068,"Acc. to this article, an official from ent music industry stated #Sulli was having hard time due to malicious comments, she made it clear with this situation to the company (SM) through her manager. https://t.co/Bgb6dbpRu6 #KoreanUpdates VF https://t.co/cx11jMBuli"

9070,"seeing news abt kim soohyun, i feel soo fucking sorry for the women who had to work with that creep over the years and i wish kim saeron, sulli, and everyone else ever involved with him will get the justice they deserved... i hope my man jaejoong isnt anything like that monster."
9071,"Sulli and Saeron were bullied to death.  Bae Suzy and Irene received death threats for supporting feminism. Hyekyo was witch hunted,IU was sent death threats for speaking against the president etc
 This is what Korea is for like women.
While the men go Scot free."
9072,"mind you the movie has extended the sulli hate train for more years. she was already being witchhunted by the media at the time, then she was the scapegoat for the movie flopping and for that scene"
9073,"sulli: i will never forget this moment.. 🥹🥺 you are so pretty, unnie~"" 

taeyeon: ""you can forget it~ you can forget it.. 😊🫳 we just have to make another one"" *moments https://t.co/YaTJBbzZjC"
9074,Leave Sulli alone. He was her friend until her last moment. Stop using her to defame GD when she always genuinely loved him deeply.
9075,"I really wish people would be careful when talking about Sulli. Please refrain from adding groundless spices, especially when you weren't there for her when it happened."
9076,I’m not defending Kim Soohyun here. I haven’t been a fan of his since he let Sulli be shamed violently over starring in his disaster of a movie REAL. Just also hate GaroSero
9077,as much as i enjoy QOT i had this lil hatred for this man bc when he did movie with sulli in 2017 she got hate for it and he didn't ( cuz they showed some nudity) he did drama with soe yeji she got hate and pple spread lies abt her and he got none....its finally his downfall 🙏🏼
9078,"I hate how people expect the f(x) members to speak on Sulli’s passing when it’s obviously a open wound for them to talk about still, they should be allowed to do it on their own accord…"
9079,@TSshifa Sulli was murdered by the disgusting amount of cyber bullying and malicious comments she endured alongside the emotional abuse from her mother. Please stick to facts and let her rest in peace.
9080,"please dont forget this kim soohyun issue for women like sulli, saeron and yeaji. for people like yeri and yeaji who are clearly hinting how vile that man is. i care about what koreans do to him but even if he is not blacklisted never support his dramas"
9081,"only 3% of all meus know that Sulli, Amber and Krystal were infected with the swine flu in 2009 https://t.co/ZvGhvthhsc"
9082,"not only kim soohyun is a pedophile but he's a murderer that drove kim saeron and sulli to suicide. i think this needs to be emphasized. it was calculated abuse to refuse wonbin to pay saeron's debt, giving her number to journalists, and destroying her reputation"
9083,Did Seo Yeaji dirty (granted she was wrong but a little support would’ve gone a long way) blamed Real for flopping on Sulli when he was the main star in that movie and had people bully that girl till she took her life and said nothing.
9084,"U can see Amber wasn’t expected this exact question. She talked about how she overcome Sulli’s passing through her perspective only in her friend Eric’s podcast very briefly, very carefully. But this interviewer just plainly asked ‘what happened with Sulli?’. So unprofessional,"
9085,"For Sulli it's because they (he and GM) used that ONE scene as marketing for his movie while she was massively bullied for it by knetizens.
Sulli endured many things but this was disgusting of them. They never even defended her and kept using it as promo for KSH's movie."
9086,"There is something off, Sulli who was bullied too during the Real movie with him,the movie is a flop &amp; the person who got more blame is Sulli &amp; she was bullied to the max from the media&amp;  fans then committing suicide, &amp;now Kim Sae Ron is committing suicide too during his Birthday"
9087,"F(X) deserves to grieve properly. Just like Jonghyun, they should be able to remember Sulli by her presence, loving personality, and her work. They shouldn't have to rehash or be asked such invasive &amp; disrespectful questions."
9088,Sulli was a victim of knetz. No you can't undo Knetz sins or help wash their hands off this. Yes KSH exploited her but she was an adult so the case is different from KSR. Knetz klled her with their words. She pleaded with them to stop hating her but they kept bullying her.
9089,"I think it’s unfair to equate these two cases because if you followed kpop before sulli’s death you’ll remember how she was hated on for even breathing, the bullying went far beyond the backlash she got for that movie and saeron’s memories deserve to have their own spotlight"
9090,"Nothing disgusts me more than stans who act like activists, reposting about Sulli, Goo Hara, Sae-ron, and any case of mistreatment, yet turn around and call living women slvts, wh0r3s, and S3oul cycle without an ounce of empathy. YOU are exactly what’s wrong with this industry"
9091,"Using sulli naked scene to promote his movie, flopped &amp; they blamed her, whole country even internationally slutshamed her, where is he? Crying in media then went to military eww"
9092,Never understood how some of you continued to support Kim Soohyun after what he had done to Sulli. I'd always got bad vibes from him and ever since that movie I've wished for his downfall. May he rot in hell!
9093,"This man’s agency  pushed for Sulli to do that 18 scene all while her mental health was at its lowest. 

You mean he was also dated a minor, dumped her, then sued her pay to  contract loans all at once even though he knew she couldn’t afford it? 

Man took a class on abuse."
9094,"The unpleasant feeling when people keep shipping him with my woman😬. His vibe is off but idk what it was. Is it him or the people branding him as ""innocent green flag"" that I dislike the most. But the one trigger me the most is bec of how he behave towards Sulli back in 2017."
9095,"Fuck you Kim Soohyun you ruined the careers and lives of many women who trusted you. You used them and discarded them as per your convince to make yourself look better. Kim saeron, sulli, and now SEO yeji how many women's lives have you made miserable????"
9096,i shall never forget how sulli was bullied after their movie was shown and the bull show he had to put through by crying to have sympathy ugh disgusting
9097,"Sulli at 23 star in a movie created by KSH's cousin and him(29), they gave her a naked scene, promoted the movie with her scene, when movie is terrible, they all blame it on her naked scene while he cowardly ran away to military. Around that time he's already grooming Saeron."
9098,"What's sad is after the death of Jang Ja yeon, Go Hara, Sulli, Kim Sae Ron only then they became a catalyst for conversations about sexual abuse and mental health but no one did anything when they were alive and reaching out to people for help. Entertainment industry is hell"
9099,I see everyone is shocked like he didn't throw Sulli to the wolves when she was young &amp; vulnerable on top of asking for a kindergartener when he was 21. You knew about this but closed both eyes &amp; preferred to dogpile on a groomed girl instead.
9100,"why does amber have to go through so much with this? just because she speaks english yall think its okay to ask her so much about it, it probably hurts her to think about just let her live and grieve :( sulli would want her friends to be happy and think about her positively"
9101,"I remember when these resurfaced and Kim Soohyun's shooters said people were hating but in between these, yoona referring to him as a psycho, the sulli situation and his questionable past, anyone can see he is not a good person but y'all will defend the devil without pay. https://t.co/33QV0ZkWst"
9102,"I prayed for Kim Soohyun downfall when I heard about his trash movie and Sulli svicide, he played victim card and went to military letting her take all the hate and eventually k!lling herself and when he got discharged he was in a drama, restored his image like nothing happened"
9103,Production expected it to be a successful film despite having a crappy script because Kim Soohyun is on it flopped then hate was formed towards Sulli because Knetz love to protect d*ckhead. So on top of hate train Sulli got coz' of Choiza was criticized also because of this.
9104,"kim soohyun was a weirdo way before saeron; kissed 16 year old suzy and threw sulli under the bus. i'm glad people are waking up to his antics and how gross he is now and may he get hell for this, either in this lifetime or after..."
9105,"as sulli defender when she was alive, i witnessed how kpop stans talking shit about her work, relationship, appearance, clothes, and instagram posts. i'll never forgive y'all."
9106,sulli faced a lot of online harrassment and bullying throughout her career bcs of that. my poor sulli😔
9107,"Sulli and Saeron were groomed by industry seniors, but instead of questioning the men  involved they were blamed for it in the media. Jinsil as well as Hara went through AND won legal battles against their abusers just to be shamed and defamed by the internet at the end."
9108,"both seo yeji and sulli’s career was finished because of him and his cousin, they were s*ut shamed name called etc. he should be in jail for the atrocity but seeing him getting the taste of his own medicine satisfies me sm hoping this is the first step of his downfall"
9109,"Wtf? So it's not the first time he didn't attend a funeral of a labelmate. But still, he should've paid respect for the deceased when he has ""connection"" especially Sulli who worked with him in his shitty movie and his ex which he dated for 6 years"
9110,policing someone else’s grief like this is so repulsive to me. people like this clearly see sulli as just a story rather than a real person who was loved by everyone around her.
9111,"i'm sorry becausw after what kim soohyun did to sulli, i never looked at h the same way. he's cunning."
9112,"May you finally have a good rest, beautiful soul :"") We hope that just like your name, you can meet the world again as a stronger and more beautiful small flower that gives smile to people around you.

The world now might not deserve you. Have a safe trip, Choi Jinri ♡ #Sulli https://t.co/9hmrUVMlDP"
9113,"Kim Soohyun is not only a pedo but also a cold, heartless monster…I mean everything he did to her and also earlier to Sulli who also later killed herself is truly sick n disgusting"
9114,why can’t you guys remember sulli for the artist she was why is she only mentioned when somebody else passes away in comparison form why isn’t her activism talked about more why do y’all never talk about her as a person
9115,leave sulli out of this she was bullied relentlessly for years by knets and korean media u don’t know shit
9116,he’s beyond disgusting  not only did he get sulli bullied to the point of death he also groomed this girl and extorted her at the worst moment of her life … he deadass needs to go 🫢 https://t.co/IaNvEZVstf
9117,"Stop acting as if that movie was the reason people started harassing Sulli or whatever, netizens (not only korean) were nasty towards her just because they couldn't deal with her having a mind of her own. Focus on him grooming Sae-ron, let's not derail away from her."
9118,the way everyone is shocked that soohyun is not a good person at all when he threw sulli under the bus during his own film release by acting disgusting and letting her receive all the backlash and bullying
9119,Kim Soohyun was dead in my eyes when he was crying in public about Sulli’s acting &amp; attitude making everyone gang up on her then hiding in the military when everyone realized Sulli was the thing that saved that god awful movie … like he should just die fr
9120,he's an ass but u guys need to cut it out with dragging every other woman into it....and leave sulli alone tf it's been years and even in death you're using her as fodder.
9121,"Me after Kim soo hyun was exposed,  I knew he wasn’t a good person ever since Sulli was harassed over a movie they were both in, and this man was praised for it. https://t.co/Hus46enWuU"
9122,jesus christ can people leave sulli alone in their quest to a hit tweet ???  her death was a result and accumulation of MANY MANY factors. factoring it to that fuck ass movie alone with ksh would undermine her ex boyfriend and the industry’s role
9123,They literally promoted her intimate scenes like crazy it was already fuel for the fire to keep burning for their hatred of Sulli even more worse since she was dating Choiza from Dynamic Duo at the time… but damn what do I know? You’re already doing what they’ve done to her https://t.co/6IIF5LBolf
9124,If ever #KnockOff will be released and suddenly Kim Soohyun becomes everyone's ideal man again. May these photos be a reminder that he ruined 3 lives thru media manipulation. 1 leads to career hiatus and 2 leads to su*cide just because they're a WOMEN in a patriarchal country. https://t.co/8qtzvjO5PV
9125,sulli was already getting hate before that movie. and I'm not gonna let you pin her death on one person when multiple people failed her. you putting it down to that movie and that man completely ignores the role choiza played in everything
9126,"One particularly chilling aspect of recent events is Kim Soohyun's media manipulation, which we've long been aware of. Despite Kim Soohyun being the actual cause of inflated actor fees in qot, every single related negative report has featured Jiwon's photos - I repeat, every one. https://t.co/Lm7azVepJ2"
9127,"starting to understand that the only reason kim soohyun's managed to make it this far is because he's been consistently throwing women under the bus to shield himself from any media fallout 

sulli, yeji, saeron, jiwon... he needs to go"
9128,Clocked Kim Soohyun being weird ever since 2015 his flop ass movie came out with Sulli who was experiencing such heavy cyber bullying &amp; slut shaming I remember it vividly watching them go ham on her bc of her intimate scene with him &amp; he didn’t even say shit to defend her https://t.co/pt28S4BSo8

9491,"Irene and her never ending self improving attitude. She used to be scared of heights, but she goes zip lining in their reality show, and her being a smooth driver when she's also once afraid of driving. And now she learned how to swim like 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 THAT'S QUEEN RIGHT THERE https://t.co/laXAN3k6dY"
9492,heart kinda hurts seeing how irene got one of the highest first week sales for the year in her agency but still rakes a low physical score just because her agency's manufacturing partners can't square up on the demand BOI DAFUK R U DOIN WAKE UP @SMTOWNGLOBAL https://t.co/RSjJRxR16l

- a deep thinker
- actually a huge dork
- childish pranks are her fav
- loves butts
- always thinking of fans https://t.co/Rmg9f2TDo8"
9495,irene is the type who will not hang your chat. she will talk and tell you when the conversation is over or will wait you until you really convey your words till goodbye. https://t.co/xPxPA3Z5ME
9496,"Irene has primarily built trust through her unwavering honesty. 

Nowadays, she's known and loved for saying it how she sees it, never masking her expressions, being true to who she is as a person. But these characteristics aren't always respected. https://t.co/nMgJ0XWtn9"
9497,"Irene is firm when she needs to be and she has the ability to make people around her listen to what she has to say, may it be a good feedback or constructive criticism. A lot of times, they have mentioned her to be scary but that’s because Irene takes being a leader seriously."
9498,"To the comments who said Irene is known to have a “Diva attitude” in the industry, mind you, 60+ staffs defended her. They defended her not for what happened in that room, bc only them knows what really happened, but for the allegations that she is known to have a bad attitude."
9499,irene talking about how she wants to try acting on radio shows and interviews when in fact she already snatched a role for her big screen debut omg i'm so happy for her!!
9500,I also love that Irene isn’t gullible—she thinks things through before acting upon it. She doesn’t let others dissuade her from what she believes  is right. She is also unapologetic regarding things she need not apologize for and that in itself is very admirable.
9501,irene is korea’s it girl and an elegant awe-inspiring presence who strikes fear into the hearts of men but she plays around with her loved ones over text with all the grace of a teenager whos just been given a smartphone. how can you not love her
9502,"honestly I can't anymore with comments portraying irene as this stone cold ice princess when really, she is such a kind and funny woman who likes to have fun and smile, just like everyone else https://t.co/cKGWjHkR9o"
9503,"no i don't understand why is irene always being brought up into other idols' issues?? she apologized multiple times and took accountability for her actions and 60+ staffs were defending her, y'all need to stop comparing a workplace argument with the serious bully issues"
9504,Irene's attitude towards men makes soooo much sense when you know how women are treated in Korea if I see her glaring at a man I just assume he's a massive weirdo
9505,"@lisoochie Not even “ attitude” we have no idea what happened with irene, 60+ staff members defeded her but no one cared. Everyone is allowed to have a bad day of she was probably defending herself but still got so much more hate then leteral SA offenders"
9506,"Irene, once you put up your opinion on X you opened up to conversation.
You can’t say you’re not interested in the debate your opinion is generating and then complain about Hundeyin’s attitude toward being opposed."
9507,"not but fr something about today’s irene is so endearing, being smiley and loud and her energy as a whole. ily queen hope u never lose that smile"
9508,feels like irene is really feeling herself this 2020 she goes from confident and charismatic on every single on red velvet and i&amp;s stage to comfortable and having the time of her life in tv and reality shows....... i am so happy to see her like this 🥺🥺
9509,irene is SO funny she is the most grown put together woman.. leader of one of korea's top groups.. inspires fear in the hearts of men.. but will throw all of that away in 0.2 seconds just to win a game
9510,honestly need everyone to stop doubting irene's dedication and passion for her job when she felt just as hopeless as seulgi during those times... yet chose to stick it through with seulgi despite the uncertainty. she fought hard for her dreams too🥲

9534,"it’s funny to see how irene can seem so Serene and Above Us Mortals but really she’s a down to earth, fun, loud, playfully overdramatic person.. just so warmly normal LOL"
9535,friendly reminder: pretending irene isn't one of kpop's best performers is NOT a personality trait no matter how hard you try to make it one https://t.co/Jjfm7nXDLC
9536,nevertheless it didn't change how i see irene. we have watched her for more than 6 years and she showed us much more positive attitudes than this humanly mistake. it doesn't define who she truly is. she did what she can do and is reflecting from it.
9537,irene’s a good idol rapper who doesn’t really get to show her potential since she mainly does talk-singing in the newer songs but their older discography has some great moments  https://t.co/DlDLqbhjRY
9538,"I wish non-ReVeluv's would see this and realize how much of an adorable, lovely, funny person Irene is!!! Who just has an infectious laugh and enjoys being silly! I hate when they peg her as always having this cold and serious persona 😕, because she 1000% is the opposite! ☺️"
9539,"what really gets me about irene is that despite everything, the negative comments, the criticism, she stands her ground of being herself in every single situation regardless of what people may say and it’s so heartwarming cause she just wants to be liked for who she is"
9540,irene gave her fans the greatest words of wisdom of all when she dropped “wait with respect”
9541,Love you guys but the children have no respect for greg watsoevr   Not cool the attitude towards him.
9542,crazy to me how people will go on &amp; onnnnn about how irene doesn’t want to be an idol or that she needs to just start acting. the same woman who gave her all to perfecting one part in a single choreography that she needed hospital treatment many times. give irene her flowers
9543,IRENE WAS SO IN CHARACTER SHE IS SO UNSERIOUS PLS I 100% BET SHE CHOSE THIS CHALLENGE 😭 https://t.co/Ya4zcNLyNF

9550,"irene auditioned to become an idol in 10th grade. when she didn’t make it through, she became so active on a forum for wannabe idols that she was promoted to admin. when she was finally accepted into sm, she trained for FIVE years. being an IDOL is her dream and she’s living it"

9552,irene is seriously so sweet and so kind and so thoughtful. every time i think she’s peaked in terms of thoughtfulness she comes back with something even more considerate… i love her so bad

9554,"irene: perfects every performance, talks about how important it is to her, sings non-stop in eye contact cams, live streams, during other members parts on stage

some goof: yeah anyway so irene hates performing and you all suck for wanting more for her as a performer 🤓"
9555,"irene is an amazing dancer, singer, actress, and she isn’t only a visual. she deserves to have more opportunities to showcase her talents and capabilities"
9556,"since some of you need a guide, here are the things you can and should hype irene up for:
- her pretty voice and impressive range
- her fluid, synchronous dancing
- her brief acting work
- her impact in the industry
- her kind, generous, strong personality
- her leadership skills"
9557,"irene's dance lines are clean, her vocals are stable and fit well when harmonizing with other members, she's killing that high-teen concept at 30, her facial expressions are on-point, and she's rocking the world with her visuals ahh I'm in love🥺"
9558,irene is actually so real for not giving af about being an idol and updating her fans once a month cuz this sht is so annoying
9559,hilarious how irene's selfie game is still stuck in pre-2020s. just made me wonder how she would've been 3rd gen's suzy if she didn't fuck up her career with her attitude problems
9560,it’s so crazy that there are people who genuinely believe irene has no impact when TO THIS DAY she is selling out everything she touches. showing someone else’s viral moments when irene is trending on a daily basis for BREATHING
9561,Going back to Bolt shem! Even though she costs more but I can't with Uber drivers' attitude! 👐🏾 I'm enough! 🚮
9562,irene have a very mature personality but the way she talks to us and tease us in bbl will always be soft cuz she doesn't show this side of her to anyone except the ppl she really care about🥺
9563,"Attitude ni Irene before towards Ling is driven sa fact na favored si Caroline ng Papa nya + their mixed family might not be good for her mental state with the siblings competition and all. But now that she knows the real deal, she’s very accepting sa kung ano ang totoo."

9566,"this is why irene has such a tough and calm exterior (doesn't cry/express her concerns) her energy really does translate to her members too. i still think she would have been less nervous if a member was there with her because then they'd need their ""irene unnie"" to rely on."
9567,i hope we get more opportunities where irene get to speak her thoughts and express herself cuz she obviously put her heart and mind to work to reflect on what she truly wants to achieve instead of merely acting out a role 🥺 https://t.co/utTbsXGoP6
9568,@wanmandu I can help with translation. Park Soo Young was saying how Irene was their mother confessor. Big sister. Helped with their problems. But interviewer asked her who does  Irene go to
9569,Irene tearing up because Joy mentioned how she doesn’t open up about her own struggles and always puts the members first. 😞 https://t.co/QBQ1gQAFL2
9570,"BYE. i just realized that irene has her face turned away from joy more than the camera and the cast member beside her.
i'm pretty sure she doesn't like crying in front of others, but especially her members. she took being a ""pillar of strength"" for them to heart fr. best leader🥲"
9571,"irene is really that kind of person, right? that kind of person who treasures every moment with someone. gets satisfied whenever the people around her are happy"
9572,"irene - human first. before anything else

she has feelings. she gets mad. she gets upset just like anyone. just like us. 

apologizing and owning up to her mistake speaks courage. 

let’s not judge someone because of that one mistake they commited. 

to brighter future ahead ❤️"
9573,just a thought but I love how irene have gotten more confident and open now. before she was so shy and careful and would always cling to her members (even until now ofc) you can really see the difference if you watch their old videos 😭💖 https://t.co/cksvrMPVId
9574,"KOREA REALLY HATES WOMEN.
 
MEN BEING A RAPIST, ABUSERS AND STILL LIVE A COMFORTABLE LIFE BUT GODFORBID WOMEN FOR SHOWING ATTITUDE. Take note irene’s only crime was for calling out unprofessional stylist yet she’s being called devil alongside with a literal pedo.🤦‍♀️"
9575,"y’all EVIL for dragging Irene into this. all she do was having an attitude. she apologized, move on. 
this other mf was literally GROOMING a child, a child that ended her life at HIS BIRTHDAY. he stole her life from her. 
do not compare."
9576,irene is actually the warmest and funniest person i dont understand why people need to keep forcing this ice princess cold personality on her when shes just shy in the beginning ☹️
9577,"Irene is unapologetic about being herself. She’s already questioned why ppl expect her to smile.

Call her cold, boring, but Irene doesn’t pander to society’s expectations. Her calm, professional demeanor is part of her and we CELEBRATE that. Don’t like it? That’s /your/ problem."
9578,irene is funny i’m sorry. everytime the tl is in shambles she’s coming with a “hello” “the weather is not nice it’s too windy” like girl reassure your kids😭
9579,"irene’s real name means “The existence of the pillar”, her stage name means “Goddess of Peace”, her MBTI is INFJ, and her position in group is leader 😲"
9580,"I would have attitude issue if I were  in that industry too. A male senior even tried to flirt inappropriately with Irene in front of camera once, just imagine how much worse female idols are treated behind the camera."
9581,Irene is a little bit cold &amp; expressionless on stage which is a minus point for an Artist. y'all are calling her Devil for that? you have issues with her attitude but never noticed how she looked uncomfortable in short dresses given by company? Who is real Devil here?
9582,"irene is one of the best leader ever, she’s strict but she knows how to take care of the members well. she always put the burden and pressure on herself and not anyone else. she deserves everything.  https://t.co/5l9ICy3M4K"
9583,the way irene is the most normal and natural idol I’ve ever seen like shes never tried to please any camera or anything shes just vibing
9584,but they dropped irene right away after the attitude incident
9585,"“irene is focused on her work”
“not many women work harder than her”

9589,And even “ attitude” is way too much for what irene did
9590,"Lol Irene just had an attitude, don't put her next to a fucking criminal."
9591,Irene’s only problem is her attitude that day. Don’t compare it with the guy who groomed A CHILD then manipulated and exploited her to death
9592,But the moment Irene got big backlash because of her attitude you guys terminated it immediately? Mfs
9593,nothing wrong with that but irene is constantly thrown under the bus over this perception and bg stans love using her as a moral ground for their male idols. all of this just bc she’s extremely introverted
9594,i didn't even remember that prada dropped irene when her attitude controversy came to light. that was wrong but what an unserious reason to drop a brand ambassador.
9595,like im sorry but y'all will never make me think 100% of the ppl who dragged irene when the attitude controversy happened have never had to apologize for treating another person bad during a bad day

9597,man knetz keep grouping irene with the worst men in that country when all she did was have a bad attitude on a bad day. they piss me off.

9600,irene looks like a mother who just picked her rebellious daughter up from the school counseling room https://t.co/UHOAQLJsto

9603,Just a quick reminder that Prada quickly dropped Irene as their brand ambassador when she had an attitude controversy so this is actually disgusting because a man with far more serious issues is still being given a chance.
9604,"Apparently, in Prada’s books, being accused of having an attitude is worse than being a gr00mer and a manipulator. They cut Irene off as fast as lightning when she had a attitude controversy while in this disgusting man, they are still deciding to give him a chance."
9605,@macaronieighty5 i was actually into kpop at the time and tbf they never even made a statement about irene they just stopped employing her and chanyeol soon after. prada actually made a statement this time as they should since kim soohyun is a pedophile
9606,"@macaronieighty5 thats not really true lol? we never got to know the reason + they also dropped chanyeol at the same time so i’m pretty sure it was a SM thing or bc covid hit and they had to cut down expenses like global ambassadors idk, but now let’s not lie and spread misinformation 🤷🏻‍♀️"
9607,"This is how you can tell that Prada is such a misogynistic brand because the moment Irene had a fcking attitude controversy, they cut her off as fast as lightning meanwhile they are still giving this gr00mer a chance despite all the proofs."
9608,"Lsf are called bad singers because they are bad singers. Meanwhile, your fandom calls women sluts, whores, p3dos, and make constant accusations of “sleeping their way to the top” which is hate speech solely due to their gender. Not the same in the SLIGHTEST."
9609,"That one so-called “OT7” BTS fanbase with more than 2.4M followers is so bitter about Jimin’s success, and they’re not even hiding it anymore, but as always, no army will question them bc 98% of this fandom is OT6 themselves.💀"

10246,"Hyuna chose to associate herself with Junhyung who's complicit in the burning sun crimes. To say he's not getting hated would be a lie, shes just more relevant. It's not misogynistic to criticize her, misogyny is acting like she was obligated to stay with Dawn. Yall stressing me. https://t.co/NpTpF1ejuF"

And it's dehumanizing to treat Dawn like a 2 year old child without agency who can’t make his own decisions"
10255,"I'm all for holding people accountable, but hold them accountable for things they have done, not made up crimes that others have committed or that you somehow decided they are guilty of simply because you ""feel so""

This only minimizes the role of the perpetrators."
10256,"What's more, Hyuna has been getting bullied for 9 months and receiving a thousand times more hate than the actual MEN who committed the crimes and SA, simply because her husband brushed off a video he was sent without context almost 10 years ago.

How is that fair?"
10257,"All I got from this whole thing is that some K-pop fans are allergic to checking their sources and facts before spreading info they see online, when the misinfo relates to SERIOUS issues like SA and abuse, you know, issues where accuracy and level headedness matter."
10258,"❌“She ruined Dawn’s career” 

- Dawn has 10x more followers than any Pentagon member on Instagram 
- He released one his most successful song after their break-up. 
- And is getting featurings with big names like Jay Park and GroovyRoom  

How is his career ""ruined""? https://t.co/1lD0VzVwgD"
10259,"❌“Hyuna cheated on Dawn”

✅ Dawn furiously denied that she cheated and was going to sue people who spread the rumors that she did when they first broke up, because it wasn’t true. So where is this even coming from? https://t.co/b451OZypuJ"
10260,"In fact..

Junhyung and Hyuna were one of the OG Kpop ships even BEFORE they met Hara separately because of their undeniable chemistry, and there was even a channel entirely dedicated to their moments from 2009-2016.

Everybody acts like he’s a random dude she picked up when..

- They’ve been friends for 16+ YEARS since 2008
- They trained and debuted together
- And were very very close

This predates JunHara dating in 2011 https://t.co/c3U3LVfkmF"
10262,"❌“Hyuna is marrying her dead best friend’s ex“

✅Hyuna and Hara were NOT besties. They appeared on the same show in 2009 (Invincible Youth) with other female idols - but neither Hyuna or Hara have mentioned, followed, interacted or acknowledged each other after 2012. https://t.co/bJAvEm65qX"

10264,"✅“He didn’t report on JJY filming Molka”

✅Yes, while it’s certainly not easy to become a whistleblower to another celebrity's crimes, it still sucks that he didn't report JJY. He's been apologizing for not doing so since 2019, and took full accountability for his inaction. https://t.co/WXDP2VWx2q"
10265,"He has never been arrested, charged, investigated nor convicted of any crime and his “involvement” was locker room talk at the least, &amp; not reporting an nonconsensually -sent- video of a woman being touched at a bar, at most."
10266,"❌“He literally admitted it in court”

✅He was NEVER taken to court, was not charged nor investigated for any crime. He was questioned by the police as a witness NOT a suspect and testified against JJY with whatever he knew (hidden camera filming not SA) https://t.co/T52osxOoX5"
10267,"What he knew is that he filmed Molka (hidden cam), and he cut him off shortly after finding out in 2016 which he explains in his apology.

And by 2019, when the Burning Sun stuff was happening, Junhyung had NO relationship with JJY or any of the guys involved."
10268,"❌""He still knew about SA and didn't report it""

✅He never knew that JJY SA’d or dr*gged women because those convos were in OTHER group chats, and there is absolutely nothing from the investigation that indicates he knew of the extent of JJY's crimes."
10269,"📃 KBS managed to obtain a 67-page document of JJY's OFFICIAL court ruling with details of every illegal video JJY distributed in his chats, including the one sent to Junhyung without context. Description of said video below.

10270,"❌""He watched women being SAd/r@ped""

✅He did not receive R*** VIDEOS, or even a s*xtape. In November 2015, JJY sent him exactly ‼ONE video‼ on a 1-1 chat of him in a bar touching a woman and the video was recorded WITH her consent but was not sent with her consent. https://t.co/AQL2DVroUr"
10271,"This led people to believe that he was PART of the JJY chats, and by the time SBS clarified that they fabricated the screenshots, it was already too late and people had made up their minds about him."
10272,"❌""He was in the groupchat and saw everything""

✅Junhyung was NOT part of ANY group chat. When the news about JJY broke, SBS edited his name into the screenshots making it seem like he was part of the group chat for shock value, which they later admitted like it was nothing. https://t.co/SFRxMDNVpg"
10273,"Also have to precise that:

Junhyung ≠ Joonyoung ≠ Jonghoon ≠ Jonghyun

Since people seem to be mixing him up with the other perpetrators and pinning THEIR crimes onto him because their names sound the same and  they can't figure out who is who and who did what."
10274,"❌""Junhyung was involved in the Burning Sun scandal""

✅He was tied to the Jung Joon Young Molka case, NOT the Burning Sun which are TWO separate cases that happened 4 years apart, but JJY's group chat (2015) was discovered through the Burning Sun investigation (2019). https://t.co/7fF2fbOEvF"

So let’s clarify a few points👇"
10276,I feel bad a lot of Hyuna’s “fans” say she was better with Dawn. They looked like they had a toxic relationship to me. They looked like they were both drowning in their mental instability than healing. I’m not sure about Junhyung but there could also be a reason why she chose him
10277,"DAWN was an adult.

DAWN was the one to then ask her to be his girlfriend. Both were consenting adults.
